# rock-paper-scissors-dtc
The project is part of the "Dicoding - Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula" course and focuses on developing a rock-paper-scissors detection system using machine learning techniques. By training a model on a dataset containing images of rocks, papers, and scissors, the system aims to accurately classify and identify hand gestures. Throughout the project, participants will learn about preprocessing image data, implementing suitable machine learning algorithms, and evaluating the model's performance to achieve reliable and efficient detection of rock, paper, and scissors gestures.
